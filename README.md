###initial idea: **"Idena-Integrated Decentralised Mining Pool: Enhancing Security and Fairness in Bitcoin Mining"**

---

#### **Abstract**

This idea introduces a novel approach to Bitcoin mining that integrates Idena’s Proof-of-Personhood system into a decentralised mining pool. Neither idena nor bitcoin consensus require adjustment, the idea rather offers an altetnative social consensus regarding rewards. This integration significantly enhances the competitiveness of individual miners using personal computers, who traditionally contribute lower hashrates compared to large centralised pools. By incorporating verified Idena identities, which require no Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, these small-scale miners can achieve a more favourable hashrate-to-reward ratio. This advantage is derived from the quadratic staking mechanism, which prioritises fairness and human verification over raw computational power.

The proposed system democratizes Bitcoin mining, making it accessible and profitable for a broader audience, thus potentially scaling Bitcoin to humanity. As this model grows, it could lead to a scenario where the profitability of mining is increasingly tied to the possession of verified identities rather than sheer computational power. This shift would reduce the emphasis on high energy consumption, aligning Bitcoin mining with broader environmental sustainability goals. While the implications of such a shift could eventually lead to more decentralised payment channels, challenging the dominance of centralised exchanges (CEXs), this broader exploration lies beyond the immediate scope of our discussion. For now, the focus is on creating a mining environment where every verified human can participate meaningfully, fostering greater decentralisation and long-term sustainability of the Bitcoin network.

#### **1. Introduction**

The centralisation of Bitcoin mining pools poses significant risks to the network’s security and the principles of decentralisation. Existing decentralised pools, such as P2Pool, offer an alternative but face challenges, including lower efficiency, which makes investing in centralised pools more profitable. This paper explores the integration of Idena’s Proof-of-Personhood with a decentralised mining pool, addressing these issues while introducing a quadratic staking model to distribute rewards more fairly among participants.

#### **2. Background**

- **2.1 Bitcoin Mining Pools:** Centralised mining pools dominate the Bitcoin network due to their ability to combine large amounts of computational power with high efficiency, leading to more frequent block discoveries and, thus, more consistent rewards. However, this concentration of power undermines the decentralisation ethos of Bitcoin and exposes the network to risks such as 51% attacks.

- **2.2 Idena Blockchain:** Idena is a blockchain that uses Proof-of-Personhood to verify human identities without requiring KYC procedures. This system ensures that each participant is a unique human being, preventing the concentration of power in the hands of a few entities. Quadratic staking in Idena further levels the playing field by reducing the influence of large stakeholders, thus promoting fairness and decentralisation.

#### **3. System Architecture**

- **3.1 Forking P2Pool:** The proposed system will begin with a fork of the existing P2Pool codebase, which is a well-established decentralised mining pool. P2Pool’s architecture allows miners to work together without relying on a centralised server, distributing the rewards according to each miner’s contribution to the pool’s total hashrate.

- **3.2 Idena Identity Integration:** To participate in the mining pool, nodes must first verify their identity through Idena. This process will involve integrating Idena’s API into the P2Pool system, where each node must present a valid Idena identity before contributing its hashrate to the pool. This verification ensures that only legitimate, unique human participants are allowed to mine, reducing the risk of Sybil attacks.

- **3.3 Quadratic Staking Model:** Once verified, participants will stake their IDNA tokens within the pool. The quadratic staking model will be implemented to determine each participant’s share of the mining rewards, like idena does it described at https://docs.idena.io/docs/iip/iip-4 . participants need to contribute hashrate to be eligable, but the ammount of hashrate does NOT define rewards alone. This model calculates rewards based on the square root of the staked amount, ensuring that smaller stakeholders who add hashrate receive a relatively larger share of the rewards, which discourages the monopolisation of the mining process by large entities.

#### **4. Implementation**

- **4.1 Node Verification Process:** The node verification process involves integrating Idena’s identity verification API with the P2Pool’s node software. Each mining node will be required to present a valid, active Idena identity to join the pool. This process is designed to be straightforward and does not require extensive technical knowledge, making it accessible to a broad range of participants.

- **4.2 Adjustments to Mining Pool Logic:** The P2Pool codebase will be modified to incorporate the quadratic staking mechanism. This adjustment involves changing the reward distribution logic so that it accounts for the square root of the staked IDNA tokens, rather than just the raw hashrate. This change ensures that the reward distribution is more equitable and aligned with the principles of decentralisation.

- **4.3 Security Considerations:** Security measures will be implemented to protect against potential attacks on the system, such as identity spoofing or network intrusions. These measures include regular updates to the node software, encrypted communication channels between nodes, and the use of secure cryptographic algorithms to verify identities and distribute rewards.

#### **5. Strategic Participation of Large Mining Pools**

Large mining pools are likely to participate in the Idena-integrated P2Pool despite initial lower rewards due to the strategic advantages they can leverage. These advantages include:

- **5.1 Investment in Idena Coins for Strategic Advantage:** Large mining pools may initially experience lower rewards due to the quadratic staking mechanism, which favours smaller miners. However, by strategically investing in Idena (IDNA) coins, these pools can increase their influence within the P2Pool system. Through staking, they can mitigate the impact of reduced rewards while positioning themselves to benefit from potential IDNA price appreciation, driven by their own mining activities and staking efforts.

- **5.2 Use of Human Farms for Higher Rewards:** Large mining pools can deploy organised groups of verified human participants ("human farms") to maximise rewards relative to their IDNA investments. By managing multiple Idena identities, these pools can distribute their staking power across numerous smaller accounts, effectively bypassing the quadratic penalty on large stakes. This approach not only enhances their staking efficiency but also increases overall participation in the Idena network, thereby boosting the robustness and security of both the Idena and P2Pool networks.

- **5.3 Speculation on Idena’s Price Growth:** As large pools integrate their operations with Idena, their involvement can lead to increased demand for IDNA, potentially driving up its market value. The anticipation of this price growth provides a powerful incentive for large pools to contribute their hash power to the network, despite initially lower rewards. Furthermore, the resulting feedback loop of rising IDNA prices and increased mining rewards could attract additional participants and investors, fostering the pool’s expansion and further decentralisation of the Bitcoin mining process.

- **5.4 Attracting New Investors and Participants:** The involvement of large pools and their strategic investments can significantly elevate the profile of the Idena-integrated P2Pool. As more hash power is added and the potential rewards for miners grow, the pool becomes increasingly attractive to new, independent miners and speculative investors. This growing interest can lead to substantial scaling of the network, enhancing both the security of the Bitcoin blockchain and the value of the Idena ecosystem.

#### **6. Long-Term Implications**

- **6.1 Reduction in Energy Consumption:** As the profitability of mining becomes increasingly tied to verified identities rather than raw hashrate, there could be a significant reduction in the overall energy consumption of the Bitcoin network. This shift would align the mining process with global sustainability goals, reducing the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.

- **6.2 Potential for Decentralised Payment Channels:** In the long run, the integration of identity verification into the mining process could lead to the development of more decentralised payment channels, reducing the reliance on centralised exchanges (CEXs). While this possibility is beyond the scope of the current project, it highlights the potential for the Idena-integrated P2Pool to contribute to a more decentralised and resilient Bitcoin ecosystem.

#### **7. Benefits and Impact**

- **7.1 Increased Fairness:** The quadratic staking model ensures that smaller miners receive proportionally larger rewards, reducing the dominance of large-scale operations.
- **7.2 Enhanced Security:** By requiring human identity verification, the system reduces the likelihood of Sybil attacks, which can compromise the integrity of the mining pool.
- **7.3 Preservation of Decentralisation:** The integration of a decentralised identity system with a decentralised mining pool furthers the goal of keeping Bitcoin mining accessible and fair.
- **7.4 Environmental Sustainability:** As mining rewards become more dependent on identities rather than energy-intensive hashrate, the overall energy consumption of the network could decrease, contributing to global sustainability efforts.

#### **8. Conclusion**

The proposed system offers a novel approach to Bitcoin mining, combining the strengths of decentralisation with the security and fairness provided by Idena’s Proof-of-Personhood. By adopting this model, the Bitcoin network can benefit from reduced centralisation risks and a more equitable distribution of mining rewards. Additionally, the emphasis on verified identities over raw hashrate could lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption, aligning the Bitcoin mining process with environmental sustainability goals.
